A not-yet-primetime-ready, Core Animation-based, D3.js-inspired drawing library for Cocoa Touch.

I'd encourage you to have a general understanding of D3.js before diving into this code. Here are two good tutorials:

[Three Little Circles](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/tutorial/circle.html)   
[A Bar Chart, Part 1](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/tutorial/bar-1.html)
[A Bar Chart, Part 2](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/tutorial/bar-2.html)

These are mostly implemented in the demo app.
