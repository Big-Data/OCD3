OCD3
====

A not-yet-primetime-ready, Core Animation-based, D3.js-inspired drawing library for Cocoa Touch.
Specifically, OCD3 uses CAShapeLayer, along with CAAnimations and D3.js-style enter/update/exit 
patterns to do data-bound drawing in a view.

While not quite a D3.js port, it is still a good idea to have a general understanding of D3.js
before diving into this code. Here are some good tutorials:

[Three Little Circles](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/tutorial/circle.html)   
[A Bar Chart, Part 1](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/tutorial/bar-1.html)    
[A Bar Chart, Part 2](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/tutorial/bar-2.html)

The code for these tutorials (along with some others, like [Pie Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887235) and [OMG Particles](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1062544))
are implemented in the provided sample app.

OCD3 is still under heavy alpha development, so its API is subject to change. It's not
recommended to use it in production code until a formal release/annoucement is made. 
Versioning will, at some point, follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
